ðŸš¨ CRITIC AGENT ANALYSIS
====================

Verdict: APPROVED WITH NOTES
Confidence: 88%

Issues Found:
1. External CDN dependencies without pinning or SRI
   - Evidence: `docs/index.html` loads `reveal.js`, plugins, Google Fonts, and `pdf.js` directly from CDNs without Subresource Integrity (SRI) or self-hosting.
   - Risk: Supply-chain alteration can impact determinism and integrity.

2. Hard-coded Google Drive file identifier
   - Evidence: `DRIVE_FILE_ID = '1AMERqqv3CZsD85Ig2AP0MfIkSfMl_7wo'` in `docs/index.html`.
   - Risk: Content mutability outside repo; breakage if the Drive file changes permissions or ID is rotated.

3. Missing CSP and security headers for static site
   - Evidence: No Content Security Policy or referrer policy configured. GitHub Pages can set headers via `_headers` or repository config, but none present.
   - Risk: Reduced defense-in-depth for XSS/asset injection.

4. Lack of automated tests or basic smoke checks
   - Evidence: No test harness to validate rendering of first slide or CDN availability. CI only deploys.
   - Risk: Silent failure if external PDF cannot be fetched or if plugin API changes.

5. Accessibility and performance checks not enforced
   - Evidence: No Lighthouse/axe CI step.
   - Risk: Regressions go undetected.

Positive Findings:
- No use of `eval`, `exec`, shell invocation, or unsafe deserialization detected.
- Minimal static footprint; clear separation under `docs/` with restricted GitHub Pages workflow permissions.
- Fallback path exists to Google Drive iframe when `pdf.js` fetch fails.

Required Actions:
- Pin CDN assets or self-host with integrity controls
  - Add SRI hashes to `<script>`/`<link>` tags or vendor assets into `docs/vendor/` and reference locally.
- External content immutability
  - Mirror `slides.pdf` into the repo (`docs/slides.pdf`) and read from a relative path; remove dependence on Google Drive ID.
- Add basic CI smoke tests
  - Headless check to ensure first slide canvas renders (or Drive iframe fallback appears) using Playwright/Puppeteer.
- Add a strict CSP for GitHub Pages
  - Example (adjust for needed origins): `default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com; script-src 'self';` when self-hosting assets.
- Add accessibility and performance checks
  - Run Lighthouse CI and axe in CI, fail on regressions beyond thresholds.

Evidence Needed for Closure:
- Git commit hash that vendors assets or adds SRI and replaces Drive dependency with local `docs/slides.pdf`.
- CI logs showing passing smoke test on render.
- Lighthouse report artifact and axe results attached to the CI run.

Traceability (Files Reviewed):
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` â€” deploy only; permissions set to `contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`.
- `docs/index.html` â€” primary logic, external CDNs, annotation overlay, `pdf.js` rendering.
- `docs/theme.css` â€” presentation overrides only.
- `docs/robots.txt` â€” allows crawling.

Risk Register:
- Supply chain (Medium): Unpinned CDNs. Mitigate via SRI or vendoring.
- Availability (Medium): Remote Drive asset dependency. Mitigate by bundling `slides.pdf` locally.
- Security headers (Lowâ†’Medium): Absent CSP; add static headers for Pages.

Suggested Tests:
1. Rendering smoke test
   - Load `docs/index.html` via `file://` and via a local server; assert at least one `canvas.pdf-canvas` has `width>0` within 5s, or Drive iframe exists.
2. Resize responsiveness
   - Trigger `resize` and assert re-render occurs (canvas size changes or `renderedPages` cleared/repopulated).
3. Annotation overlay
   - Toggle annotate, draw line, assert pixel buffer differs, clear, assert cleared.
4. Offline run
   - Block network; verify graceful fallback messaging (expect failure path) and no JS exceptions uncaught.

Uncertainty Quantification:
- Primary operational risk stems from third-party availability; with vendoring, residual risk becomes low. Without it, site reliability contingent on multiple CDNs and Google Drive uptime.
